    "**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "* Load the [traffic sign dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) \n",
    "* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set\n",
    "* Design, train and test a model architecture\n",
    "* Use the model to make predictions on new images\n",
    "* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images\n",
    "* Summarize the results with a written report\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project \n",
    "Here is the link to my code [Traffic_Sign_Classifier](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Set Summary & Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Provide a basic summary of the data set** \n",
    "\n",
    "I used the numpy and pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The size of training set is : 34799\n",
    "* The size of the validation set is : 4410 \n",
    "* The size of test set is : 12630\n",
    "* The shape of a traffic sign image is : 32x32x3 (3 RGB channels)\n",
    "* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is : 43 ( by using set() function )\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we looked into some random sample image of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we looked at the distribution of classes in the training, validation and test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./examples/distri of train.png\" alt=\"alt text\" >\n",
    "<img src=\"./examples/distri of validation.png\" alt=\"alt text\" >\n",
    "<img src=\"./examples/distri of test.png\" alt=\"alt text\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. agumented tranning set**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason:** The distribution of data set showing above tells that there is an huge imbalance in the training set between classes. The maximum value is 2010 while the minimum value is only 180. So i thought it would be good if we could balance the traning set, and make even distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the improvement i made. I agument the training date set and made it become even distributed.\n",
    "<img src=\"./examples/agument_data.png\" alt=\"alt text\"  >\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. grayscale transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason:** we want to reduce the layers of the original images and make it traning faster. And the second reason is the work given by [naokishibuya](https://github.com/naokishibuya/car-traffic-sign-classification/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) His work shows grayscale would have better traning performace than RGB format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an original image and an grayscale image:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./examples/original.png\" alt=\"alt text\"  >\n",
    "<img src=\"./examples/grays.png\" alt=\"alt text\"  >\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. normalization transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason:** The gradient-based algorithm is used to optimize the traning results. It suggest the mean of input value should 0. So i would like to normalize the traning data set. According to [naokishibuya's work](https://github.com/naokishibuya/car-traffic-sign-classification/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb), he suggest that using the mean and standard deviation would serves as better performance. \n",
    "* The formula is : (x - x.mean()) / x.std()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The first architecture i try is LeNet model. I think this a staring point. However, The validation set accuracy can not reach 90%. The basic work i do is to make the networks much deeper than before and also add a dropout layer. Besides, i use more neurons in the fully connected layers.\n",
